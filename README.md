## Corp Comment Project

I completed this project as part of the ByteGrad advanced React and NextJs course. I am aiming to deepen my understanding of more advanced React principles and the use of the NextJs framework.

The tech stack used for the project is TypeScript, React and Tailwind CSS. 

The project is a public message board that allows you to leave feedback based on your experience with a specific company. It features hashtags and upvotes for each comment.

To run the project locally make sure to use npm install for all necessary dependencies. The use the npm run dev command.

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
